changes:
  - rscadd: "Security, HoS, Captain, Blueshield, and Centcom roles have had armour booster modules built into their modsuits. Most do not reduce the slowdown of your suit (except the HoS one)"
  - balance: "Armour values in said modsuits have been halved across the board, with the lost values moved to the armour boosters."
  - balance: "Effectively, armour in EVA combat is severely nerfed for everyone except the syndicate who already had armour boosters."
