  - balance: "'Forged' Bokken, the wooden sword that can be made on the workbench with no anvil or fuel, its now flammable, doesnt affect mobs, and does entirely stamina damage. It has 40 AP, in one hand it does 17 damage and has a block chance of 20, while wielded does 25.5 damage and has a 40 block chance. It no longer blocks proyectiles, it behaves like any other sword in the game albeit with a high block chance."
