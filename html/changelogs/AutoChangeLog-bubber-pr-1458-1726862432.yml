changes:
  - refactor: "Heavily refactors how bloodsucker powers function."
  - refactor: "Tremere powers no longer have subtypes for each level."
  - rscadd: "Completely redoes how bloodsucker ability descriptions, both the longer antag panel and the action button hover over, they will actually tell you actual values that the game itself uses for damage, cooldowns, and effect durations"
  - balance: "Tremere powers can now level up as far as you want."
  - balance: "Mesmerize is heavily reworked, now it no longer forces both parties to stand still for it to work, but it is obvious to the victim when used, however the victim is muted for the duration of the spool up, and will stun and mute normally if the do_after completes."
  - rscadd: "Mesmerize now has a secondary that allows you to mute and confuse your victim that happens on a right-click,\ndominate, the tremere's version instead knockdowns."
  - rscadd: "Tremere's dominate now has a visual timer for temporary vassals, visible only to the master's vassals and the master themselves."
  - balance: "Tremere's dominate now only requires level 2 to create temporary vassals, but the duration now scales with the level. It now requires the potential vassal to have more than 336 blood, and will use it all up once the duration ends, effectively making it only usable once per person."
  - balance: "All tremere powers can now level up past level 4"
  - balance: "Thaumaturgy is heavily reworked, it now has a charge system, and while the projectile deal less damage, you can shoot a lot more of them, and the projectiles will seek towards any non-vassal mob near where you cast it."
  - refactor: "Separates bloodsucker ability bitfields and action bitfields to avoid overriding eachother"
  - balance: "Bloodsuckers going into torpor outside of coffins will always die, but will wake out of torpor at 20% maxhealth(not counting critical health)"
  - balance: "A coffin being opened during sol will wake you up, given you are LITERALL BURNING UN-ALIVE."
