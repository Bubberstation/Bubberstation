changes:
  - rscadd: "Added the FOSBURY skillchip, found in hacked toy vendors. This skillchip allows you to bypass the emote cooldown when flipping or spinning. However, if used too often, it will lower the chip's integrity and cause malfunctions."
  - rscadd: "Added the Chipped quirk. It allows you to spawn with one base skillchip. (not the one above)"
  - rscadd: "Added the Chip Connector quirk. It contains a new implant, the chip connector, which allows you to install and take out skillchips at any time."
  - code_imp: "Renamed the organ slots for brain implants and made the connector implant take the CNS slot."
