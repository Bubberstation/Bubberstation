changes:
  - rscadd: "Proteans can now directly copy modsuit plating to transform their suit without needing an entire modsuit."
  - bugfix: "Storage modules on proteans will no longer delete when assimilating suits. It prioritizes the incoming storage and \"pushes aside\" the old storage until the suit is removed."
