  - rscadd: "Added the following items to the Syndicate Duffelbag bulky exception list: Greentext, mech removal tool, gibtonite, skub, golem shells, mech ammo. Roughly sorted the list by item category."
  - bugfix: "Fixed the syndie surgery duffelbag having more items than it can hold by removing the redundant surgical drill (Upgraded cauteries can turn into one anyways)"
  - qol: "Any storage item with a can_hold description can be examined twice to see what it can hold now."
  - bugfix: "The parent crayon's name is 'crayon' to prevent any weirdness with things that show the parent type's name."
