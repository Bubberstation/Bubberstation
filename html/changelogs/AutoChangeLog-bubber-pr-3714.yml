  - rscadd: "You can now craft a butter churn with 8 wooden planks, which can turn milk into cream, and then butter!"
  - balance: "Ashwalker gutlunches can eat sand or basalt ash to produce milk."
  - qol: "Ashwalker gutlunches no longer mix miner's salve with the resource they're turning specific ores into, meaning you get a lot more of that resource on average. They'll still produce miner's salve if fed random ores like iron, though."
