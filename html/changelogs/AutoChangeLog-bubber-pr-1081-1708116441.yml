changes:
  - rscadd: "Adds REAL banhammers send people to the void temporarily (similar to immortality talisman or void genetic power) on hit. Hitting someone on combat mode with it sends them to permabrig instead, if they're not already in the permabrig."
  - rscdel: "Replaces the High Frequency Blade the wizard gets with a REAL banhammer, and reduces the spell cost from 3 to 2."
