changes:
  - balance: "Shocked airlocks and grilles now stun you instead of just a knockdown and mild stamina damage."
  - bugfix: "Fixed repeatedly shocking yourself to crit on airlocks and grilles due to not being stunned by airlocks/grilles. Should be less directly deadly now if you don't react to stop yourself."
