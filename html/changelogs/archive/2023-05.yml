  - bugfix: Bloody Mary flavor is now accurate to its description.
  - refactor: Spiderlings are now basic mobs, report any complete weirdness/deviation
      from known behavior. They should be a lot more intelligent now though.
  - rscadd: AI Spiderlings are super fragile, but they're also super fast, especially
      when they get into a vent. Once they're in circulation, they could end up everywhere!
      Maybe in the armory, maybe in a locked closet in maintenance. Be sure to be
      vigilant and splat them whenever you can to save the station from a whole lotta
      heartache!

      both server and client-side

  - spellcheck: Deleted the extra line in combat information
