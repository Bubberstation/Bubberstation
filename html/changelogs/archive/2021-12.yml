  Iamgoofball + whoever made the contractor baton sprites I codersprite modified:
  - rscadd: 'All maps now have proper Departmental Guard offices, instead of Security

  - balance: This will encourage Guards to naturally stay near their department and
      keep it safe.
  - balance: The charges system allows Guards to punish people who kite around the
      edge of their department, while punishing Guards who over-extend too far and
      should be calling Security.
  - balance: Departmental Guards have had their cuffs replaced with colored cableties
      for their department.
  - rscadd: Departmental Guards are given security HUDs, not HUDglasses, primarily
      so that they can see job icons and see if someone who ran into their department
      followed by redshirts is wanted by Security or not, so as to improve communication.
  - balance: They do not have the access needed to adjust records, however, and will
      be on read-only mode.
  - rscdel: All Departmental Guard, Security Officer, HoS, and Warden Stun Batons
      have been removed from the backpack, and are now in the belts in your security
      lockers, instead of in your backpack.
  - balance: 'This is to keep the number of batons on the map at a consistent level
      regardless of Security staffing. qol: Your Security Belt can now be reskinned
      between Security and Peacekeeper variants.'
  - balance: Brig Officers have had their baton replaced by a Departmental Prison
      Baton.

      because it's not 2012 anymore and we don't give Security tasers.
  - rscdel: Security Medics have had their telescopic batons removed, because that's
      a Head of Staff item and shouldn't be available to rank and file staffers. Telescopic
      baton creep is a problem and is being slowly addressed.
  - rscdel: Security Medics have had their firearm removed, as it was an oversight
      from the original Goofsec PR, and they shouldn't be packing heat like that over
