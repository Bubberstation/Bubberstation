  Higgin:
  - balance: Major borer rebalance. Borer abilities now generally cause brain damage
      up to and including traumas. Borers can no longer heal brain damage/traumas
      on their own. Borers require living hosts to gain stats, chems, or heal. Hosts
      must manage more significant costs even with passive borers. Borer objectives
      are now much more realistically achievable, and willing hosts contribute to
      much greater boosts for borers than unwilling hosts. Borer actionspeed/movespeed
      buffs reduced. Borers have stamina damage and confusion on their Fear ability
      as well as the ability to make Multiver (a chem purger) and Mindbreaker Toxin
      (a hallucinogen that can be used to brainwash/incapacitate) without learning
      from prior samples.
