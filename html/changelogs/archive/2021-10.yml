  - bugfix: Disposal outlets no longer constantly shoot you out at an incredibly dangerous

      10 brute damage they were at last year, though you can still multitool/emag

      addition to reducing the delay the limp adds.

      limbs, take no damage from applying this fix, don't need surgical tape, and
      recover 4x as fast as fleshy humans do from these improvised fixes. Shine on,

      designs to autolathes with a variable that does the same when set FALSE. Energy

      a near-invisible underlay.

      cases when the HFR was unpowered, out of fuel, interacted with other subsystems

      pretty decal on the affected part while becoming immune to all future cracking
      conditions, as long as nobody repaired the crack. The initial spill if highly
      pressurized is still the most dangerous, but the HFR will continue to slowly
      leak its contents even under low pressure while cracked. content: The HFR initially
      took damage at unsafe fusion levels with excess mass over 2500-1500 moles, depending
      on temperature. This was later changed to 2700-2589 moles, but in a way that
      looked like it was only meant make the thresholds a few hundred moles more tolerant.
      The range is now 2700-1800 moles.'
  - bugfix: HFR production rate is no longer multiplied by both the fuel consumption
      modifier and the gas production modifier. This means the top tier Hypernoblium/Anti-noblium

      pipes which are on completely different layers and do not interact with the
      new pipe in any way.
  - bugfix: Smart pipes with less than two allowed directions can no longer be built.
      The pipe would be invisible, but still interact in weird ways.
  - bugfix: 'One tile can no longer have more than one atmospheric component ready
      to connect in the same direction and layer. This prevents the scenario where
      a temperature pump is placed in a manner which looks like it''s going to connect
      to a horizontal bridge pipe, but actually turns the vertical plasma input pipe
      behind it into a manifold, ruptures the connected plasma canister, and sets
      Toxins on fire. qol: Smart pipes are now much, much smarter. During construction,
      if a smart pipe would block placement of a component, it will see if permitted
      connectivity can be reconfigured to make room for other components. This includes
      negotiation with other smart pipes, preferring to create pipe crossings where
      available, or create an opposing corner pipe if not. The RPD can now also reconfigure
      allowed connectivity for existing smart pipes manually. Smart pipes can never
      be reconfigured to have less than two allowed directions, and active connections
      cannot be reconfigured. Automatic reconfiguration will never cause a smart pipe
      to permit connectivity that was not previously permitted.'
  - bugfix: Multi-layer pipe components can trigger smart pipe negotiation where relevant.

      use documented and centralized helpers for bit manipulation where sensible.

      to 6 characters
  - refactor: Radiation Collectors, Tesla Coils, and Grounding Rods are now subtypes
      of a common energy_accumulator type. This centralizes logic for smoothing energy
      release; converting between Joules, Watts, and internal energy units; and ensures
      that all such accumulators display and generate power along the same smoothing
      curve.
  - bugfix: Tesla Coils no longer generate power using half the smoothing that Radiation
      Collectors used. This was due to a mistake in handling delta_time.
  - code_imp: 'Removed many magic numbers from power generation code. qol: Tesla Coils
      will now display energy stored in Joules and power being produced in Watts,
      much like Radiation Collectors did. qol: Grounding Rods will now display recent
      energy they''ve absorbed and the sustainable power that this energy could be
      producing. It should now be very obvious if you could use more Tesla Coils.'

  - bugfix: Players with the monkified mutation now have a generic monkey name as
      opposed to their actual name again.

      admin is already replying to, you'll get a notice that someone already has it
      open when you get the prompt. Nice to let you know someone else is handling
      it, so you can coordinate replies better!
  That REALLY Good Soda Flavor:
  - refactor: Rolling paper will now use the customizable reagent holder component.
      This cleans up the code and expands the possibilities for using the component

      doors.
  - bugfix: Fixed the contents of certain coded or mapped closets exceeding their
      storage capacity, like the HoS closet on Delta, which had redundant grey HoS
      jumpsuit, trenchcoat and beret, or the mixed wardrobe closet with its duplicate
      bandanas, jacket and green jumpsuits,
  - bugfix: The Lavaland Syndicate Base is now Powered again.
  - code_imp: repathed /unpowered Syndicate Base areas to /powered
  - bugfix: Gas Filters will now always attempt to move gas, as long as at least one
      output has space available. Any gas not able to be moved to its destination
      is returned to the input as if it was never removed. Previously, only gases
      for the main output port would continue to move when the other output port was
      full.
  - bugfix: Gas Filters again no longer leaves empty entries for gases that were filtered
      in the main output.
  - bugfix: Gas Filters again no longer outright destroys gas when no filters (or
      a bad filter, somehow) are set. Instead, it will go through to the main output,
      as before, or if the main output is full, be returned back to the input, as
      if never removed.
  - bugfix: Backup human names are once again respected when forcibly humanizing what
      would otherwise be a non-human head of staff.

      when entering the station or a shuttle is docked.'

      shuttle and docking bay. The lives of your fellow crew members are more important
      than your tardiness and limbs, employee!
  - bugfix: Fixed the numbering of escape pods in certain maps.
  - rscadd: 'Titlescreens are now widescreen''d up. qol: The titlescreen is no longer
      described as "Effectively impervious to conventional methods of destruction."

  - bugfix: fixed badnana spider factions
  Gonenoculer5:
  - balance: SEVA suits no longer accept goliath plates, as was intended by the original
      PR author, and now add two seconds of stun to goliath grabs. Dont shoot the
      messenger.
  - bugfix: A recent factory mixup in the core worlds made it so that SEVA suits were
      comming with plate hooks for enviromental suits. Centcom has corrected this,
      and as such SEVA suits are now back to their manufactuing spec.
  - code_imp: Relocated SEVA from explorer subtype to its own, to avoid inheriting
      plate addition from the hooded/explorer/XYZ subtype.

      the confirmation popup is still up

  ForrestWick:
  - bugfix: 'Syndicate Mouseperatives will not longer try to murder their own team
      grammar: Renames the imp to Talon Demon'
  SkyratBot:
  - bugfix: fixes a slight issue with the hair color not being visible on ghosts after
      the legacy color removal
  - bugfix: Backup human names will now properly only apply when you are a nonhuman
      head of staff, rather than any head of staff.
  - code_imp: LabeledList.Item now supports arbitrary nodes as labels. String labels
      still work as previously.
  - code_imp: RoundGauge now supports an alertBefore property, for when warnings need
      to happen below a threshold. This can combine sensibly to form ranges with alertAfter.
  - refactor: 'The HFR interface has been heavily rewritten and restructured, fixing
      many edge cases where data was empty, unset, or took extreme values. Major parts
      now have their own file. The structure of gas lists is now consistent. Static
      data is used for more values. Much presentation layer logic has been moved to
      tgui instead of dm. Some processing that should never have happened, in tgui
      or anywhere else, is now gone forever. qol: The HFR UI now displays the recipe
      specific gases that each fuel will create in a large table inside an expandable
      area. This can be collapsed when not needed. qol: The HFR UI now uses a minimum
      mass for the scale of its gas lists. This should provide a visual cue for when
      a gas mix is running out, or needs more fuel to start. qol: The HFR UI now graphs
      its various gas mixtures on a unified logarithmic scale, and tells you how fast
      the temperatures are changing in real units after all effects. qol: The HFR
      UI now displays reactor status through gauges, with scales set to indicate typical
      ranges involved, and warnings to indicate when something is going wrong. qol:
      The HFR UI now directly displays reaction instability, reaction activity, and
      the cell charge of the local APC. Reaction activity is the amount of heat output
      relative to what is permitted by the heat output limiter. This is effectively
      making explicit the result of a calculation you would otherwise need to do anyway,
      and makes it easier to notice when a reaction has stalled. qol; The HFR UI will
      now helpfully inform you in discerning red text if you have no recipe set, or
      if any one of the gas mixtures is empty. This should be particularly helpful
      for noticing when you didn''t add any coolant. Please involve coolant when operating
      a nuclear reactor. qol: The HFR UI now always lists Plasma, BZ, and Proto-Nitrate
      in the moderator gas list, and provides tooltips explaining their usage and
      purpose. qol: The HFR UI now has many other tooltips, from explaining the function
      and purpose of the various reactor controls, to the fringe effects of uncommon
      moderator gases.'
  - code_imp: heat_output_bool is gone forever yes this deserves its own changelog
      entry

  GoldenAlpharex:
  - bugfix: The razors will now properly direct you towards the right areas to aim

  - code_imp: Both hair dyes are now merged together in one, super powerful hair dye
      spray!
  Iamgoofball, Azarak:
  - rscdel: Departmental Security has been removed.
  - rscadd: 'Departmental Guards(Orderly, Bouncer, Customs Agent, Science Guard, Engineering
      Guard) have been added. qol: Security armory firearms now fire Hardlight Bullets.
      This will help with performance at extreme pop(120+) and game balance.'

      stronger, accurate shots, with each Rifle serving a unique niche now.

      power cell.

  SkyratBot:
  - rscadd: Cargo's Delivery Tagger now uses TGUI

  - rscdel: the captain can no longer unlock his display case on delta without breaking
      it

      spawn broken.

      explicit.

      Editing bans now actually works again.

  OrionTheFox:
  - imageadd: Digitigrade sprites for the Tacticasual Uniform and Cargo Tech Casual
      Wear
  SkyratBot:
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where the unbanning panel would give inaccurate information
      about the ban in the unban confirmation prompts.
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where clicking the X to close out the confirmation popup
      on the unbanning panel acted as if you'd pressed Yes.
  - admin: Added a reban button to the unbanning panel. This allows an admin to quickly
      and easily re-apply a ban they've removed and replaces the unban button when
      a ban has been removed. As a result, accidentally removing the wrong ban no
      longer requires the admin to place a second brand new ban on top of the old
      one.
  - admin: Editing the IP, ckey or CID of a server ban will now kick any players matching
      the edited ban's new details.
  - bugfix: Deadchat is now effected by OOC word filters
  - bugfix: A reason for a word being filtered will now be displayed nomatter what
      case the word is in

  - bugfix: DNA unique identity and unique feature strings once again generate correctly,
      which also means they work correctly again.
  - rscadd: Bans are now more user friendly
  - balance: If you try using the staff of change, the staff of chaos or the staff
      of healing as a crewmember, then it'll backfire. The Staff of change wabbajacks
      the user, like the pool of change; this means you can't become a xenomorph or
      a syndicate borg. The Staff of chaos has a 5% chance of firing the bolt directly
      at the user using it. The Staff of healing now behaves like a medibeam gun to
      non-wizards trying to use it.
  Solgov Station Engineering Safety Association (SESA):
  - imageadd: New thinklite(tm) brand reflective strips are now included on non-humanoid
      engineering wear as well! The Association has also updated the non-humanoid

      of mining access.
  - bugfix: Removed access requirements from southern mining station public external
      airlocks.
  - bugfix: The SM now properly provides bonus power for operating in a low pressure
      environment. Make sure you can keep it cool enough, and remember, space or a
      vacuum won't work, but it will damage the SM!
  - code_imp: Calculations relating to the SM pressure bonus are now derived from
      human readable parameters.
  - bugfix: Double Bedsheets now properly show the bedsheet sprites.

2021-10-30:
  ATHATH:
  - balance: Heavily EMPing a jumpsuit or another piece of under clothing will now
      short out its suit sensors (as if they had shorted out from damage to the jumpsuit)
      instead of randomizing their setting. You can repair them with a cable coil
      as normal.
  - bugfix: The sensor list will now be updated when your jumpsuit is EMP'd to reflect
      any possible changes in suit sensor status.
  - bugfix: Under clothing will now respect the EMP_PROTECT_SELF flag.
  Aphast:
  - bugfix: Added a locked door inside of a dangerous research facility, to prevent
      an unnecessary casualty.
  GoldenAlpharex:
  - bugfix: The AI VOX announcer voice is by default the one it's meant to be, the
      normal one.

  - code_imp: Improves the VOX announcer voice code quite a bit.
  - bugfix: Fixed the veteran-only quirks, making them available once again.
