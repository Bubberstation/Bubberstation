      the upper z-level) will now cause you to smash through it and fall to the z-level

      qol: Added a chat feedback when unable to import designs to autolathes.'

      a near-invisible underlay.

  - code_imp: moved some ai law defines to the proper file
  Wayland-Smithy:
  - bugfix: Fixed many Tramstation department sign arrows pointing to upload and vault.
  esainane:
  - refactor: Completely restructure HFR main processes, fixing many unusual edge
      cases when the HFR was unpowered, out of fuel, interacted with other subsystems
      poorly, etc.
  - refactor: HFR equations with cryptic parameters have all been rewritten to use
      mathematically equivalent normalized equations derived from human-parseable
      parameters.
  - code_imp: The HFR now has fewer superfluous and misleading checks.
  - code_imp: HFR configuration is now much more heavily documented and generally
      readable.
  - code_imp: Many HFR defines and comments which are unused, misleading, and/or completely
      inapplicable to any public release of HFR code have been removed.
  - bugfix: The HFR now only interacts with the SSair subsystem via the side IO components.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer fail to cool if atmospherics is running slowly.
  - bugfix: The HFR's ambient sound loop will no longer fail to update to match the
      current fusion level under certain conditions.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer fail to update its UI under certain conditions.
  - bugfix: The HFR will no longer melt down at speeds largely determined by the wider
      atmospherics system.
  - bugfix: The HFR can no longer get stuck in states which heal without taking damage
      or vice versa.
  - bugfix: The HFR's healing/damage effects that depend on fusion power level now
      genuinely depend on fusion power level, rather than doing nothing but at any
      power level.

      which effectively doubled the rate under some conditions.
  - bugfix: The HFR now treats Iron Content as having appropriate units - fractional

  - bugfix: 'The HFR, after cracking under pressure, will no longer merely leave a
      pretty decal on the affected part while becoming immune to all future cracking
      conditions, as long as nobody repaired the crack. The initial spill if highly
      pressurized is still the most dangerous, but the HFR will continue to slowly
      leak its contents even under low pressure while cracked. content: The HFR initially
      took damage at unsafe fusion levels with excess mass over 2500-1500 moles, depending
      on temperature. This was later changed to 2700-2589 moles, but in a way that
      looked like it was only meant make the thresholds a few hundred moles more tolerant.
      The range is now 2700-1800 moles.'
  - bugfix: HFR production rate is no longer multiplied by both the fuel consumption
      modifier and the gas production modifier. This means the top tier Hypernoblium/Anti-noblium
      recipe is now worth using, providing a production bonus of 3x rather than a
      penalty of x0.03. This recipe is still just as hard to operate safely.

      cable, and rack on the same tile.

      to use composite lists.

  - expansion: 'The Mr. Deempisi Portrait plaque has been replaced with a very special

      the confirmation popup is still up
  - bugfix: The SM air alarm on MetaStation and TramStation once again starts unlocked,

  ForrestWick:
  - bugfix: 'Syndicate Mouseperatives will not longer try to murder their own team
      grammar: Renames the imp to Talon Demon'
  SkyratBot:
  - bugfix: fixes a slight issue with the hair color not being visible on ghosts after
      the legacy color removal
  - bugfix: Backup human names will now properly only apply when you are a nonhuman
      head of staff, rather than any head of staff.
  - code_imp: LabeledList.Item now supports arbitrary nodes as labels. String labels
      still work as previously.
  - code_imp: RoundGauge now supports an alertBefore property, for when warnings need
      to happen below a threshold. This can combine sensibly to form ranges with alertAfter.
  - refactor: 'The HFR interface has been heavily rewritten and restructured, fixing
      many edge cases where data was empty, unset, or took extreme values. Major parts
      now have their own file. The structure of gas lists is now consistent. Static
      data is used for more values. Much presentation layer logic has been moved to
      tgui instead of dm. Some processing that should never have happened, in tgui
      or anywhere else, is now gone forever. qol: The HFR UI now displays the recipe
      specific gases that each fuel will create in a large table inside an expandable
      area. This can be collapsed when not needed. qol: The HFR UI now uses a minimum
      mass for the scale of its gas lists. This should provide a visual cue for when
      a gas mix is running out, or needs more fuel to start. qol: The HFR UI now graphs
      its various gas mixtures on a unified logarithmic scale, and tells you how fast
      the temperatures are changing in real units after all effects. qol: The HFR
      UI now displays reactor status through gauges, with scales set to indicate typical
      ranges involved, and warnings to indicate when something is going wrong. qol:
      The HFR UI now directly displays reaction instability, reaction activity, and
      the cell charge of the local APC. Reaction activity is the amount of heat output
      relative to what is permitted by the heat output limiter. This is effectively
      making explicit the result of a calculation you would otherwise need to do anyway,
      and makes it easier to notice when a reaction has stalled. qol; The HFR UI will
      now helpfully inform you in discerning red text if you have no recipe set, or
      if any one of the gas mixtures is empty. This should be particularly helpful
      for noticing when you didn''t add any coolant. Please involve coolant when operating
      a nuclear reactor. qol: The HFR UI now always lists Plasma, BZ, and Proto-Nitrate
      in the moderator gas list, and provides tooltips explaining their usage and
      purpose. qol: The HFR UI now has many other tooltips, from explaining the function
      and purpose of the various reactor controls, to the fringe effects of uncommon
      moderator gases.'

      about the ban in the unban confirmation prompts.
  - bugfix: Fixed an issue where clicking the X to close out the confirmation popup
      on the unbanning panel acted as if you'd pressed Yes.
  - admin: Added a reban button to the unbanning panel. This allows an admin to quickly
      and easily re-apply a ban they've removed and replaces the unban button when
      a ban has been removed. As a result, accidentally removing the wrong ban no
      longer requires the admin to place a second brand new ban on top of the old
      one.
  - admin: Editing the IP, ckey or CID of a server ban will now kick any players matching

      is returned to the input as if it was never removed. Previously, only gases
      for the main output port would continue to move when the other output port was
      full.
  - bugfix: Gas Filters again no longer leaves empty entries for gases that were filtered
      in the main output.
  - bugfix: Gas Filters again no longer outright destroys gas when no filters (or
      a bad filter, somehow) are set. Instead, it will go through to the main output,
      as before, or if the main output is full, be returned back to the input, as
      if never removed.
2021-10-22:
  Ghommie:
  - bugfix: Fixed the contents of certain coded or mapped closets exceeding their

  - bugfix: orion can now no longer give you multiple prizes
  - qol: personal lockers will now allow you to actually un/lock them without swiping
      ID
  Watermelon914:
  - balance: If you try using the staff of change, the staff of chaos or the staff
      of healing as a crewmember, then it'll backfire. The Staff of change wabbajacks
      the user, like the pool of change; this means you can't become a xenomorph or
      a syndicate borg. The Staff of chaos has a 5% chance of firing the bolt directly
      at the user using it. The Staff of healing now behaves like a medibeam gun to
      non-wizards trying to use it.
  carshalash:
  - bugfix: Squirt cider now requires salt. Tomato soup no longer becomes squirt cider

  ATHATH:
  - balance: Heavily EMPing a jumpsuit or another piece of under clothing will now
      short out its suit sensors (as if they had shorted out from damage to the jumpsuit)
      instead of randomizing their setting. You can repair them with a cable coil
      as normal.
  - bugfix: The sensor list will now be updated when your jumpsuit is EMP'd to reflect
      any possible changes in suit sensor status.
  - bugfix: Under clothing will now respect the EMP_PROTECT_SELF flag.
  ArcaneMusic:
  - bugfix: Double Bedsheets now properly show the bedsheet sprites.
  JohnFulpWillard:
  - bugfix: Bank machines will now immediately stop withdrawing funds if the machine
      is broken or unpowered.
  Melbert:
  - bugfix: The OOC messages of people with minor admin ranks now respect OOC filters
      in chat tabs
  - expansion: Two new station traits, Ionic Stormfront and Radiation Stormfront.
      They make ion storms and rad storms more common, respectively.
  Mickyan:
  - code_imp: Vending machines no longer require a unique panel overlay for each new
      type
  Mothblocks:
  - bugfix: Felinids can no longer be head of staff if human authority is required.
  - bugfix: The foreigner quirk on felinids now works as it does with all other nonhumans
      who have their own languages, rather than also giving Galactic Uncommon.
  Sealed101:
  - bugfix: fixed a runtime in physical experiments trying to unregister a signal
      from a non-existant atom
  Timberpoes:
  - qol: Ordnance, Ordnance Storage and Atmospherics have been dropped to common-level
      accesses, allowing them to be added to any ID card instead of just silver and
      specific job trimmed cards.
  Watermelon914:
  - qol: Allows you to link integrated circuits to component printers and, as a result,
      let you print components off remotely which are put directly into your circuit.
  esainane:
  - bugfix: Pressure Tanks will now refuse to accept materials without a specific
      material type during construction.
  - bugfix: Pressure Tanks will now drop the correct amount of materials during deconstruction.
  - bugfix: Pressure Tanks will now send you flying if you continue to slice open
      a sufficiently pressurized tank despite the warning, rather than doing nothing.
  - bugfix: Pressure Tanks will release their gas contents when destroyed, rather
      than voiding them.
  - refactor: Reworked `/turf/var/intact` into variables which don't conflate underfloor
      visibility, underfloor interactability, and overfloor presence. This fixes many
      bugs relating to turfs in general, especially catwalks and glass flooring.
  - bugfix: The SM now properly provides bonus power for operating in a low pressure
      environment. Make sure you can keep it cool enough, and remember, space or a
      vacuum won't work, but it will damage the SM!
  - code_imp: Calculations relating to the SM pressure bonus are now derived from
      human readable parameters.
  jlsnow301:
  - rscdel: Removed leftover HTML from spawner menu
  - refactor: Spawner menu is now easier to read
  - bugfix: The crafting menu now uses scrollable sections, fitting the window regardless

      the rest of the rear sofa sprites.
  LemonInTheDark:
  - bugfix: You're (hopefully) no longer able to make timed singlecaps using nitryl.
      I really liked this one honestly, it's got an aggressive amount of heart and
      soul
  Timberpoes feat. JohnFulpWillard:
  - config: Modified how ambiguous VALUE_MODE_FLAG keyed_list config entries are parsed
      and added additional config logging for when weirdness with keyed_list config
      entries happens in general. (Timberpoes)
  - config: /datum/config_entry/keyed_list/probability was unused and has been deleted.
      (Timberpoes)
  - bugfix: The Cloth Golem preferences profile now works (JohnFulpWillard)
  - qol: The species-changing magic mirror variants now list species names instead
      of internal code IDs. (JohnFulpWillard)
  - qol: Shadowperson species should now show as "Shadow" instead of "???" (JohnFulpWillard)
  esainane:
  - imageadd: Hot Ice icons are now consistent, and now have an stack icon showing
      two pieces for when there are between 17 and 33 pieces in the stack.

      in welding fuel.
