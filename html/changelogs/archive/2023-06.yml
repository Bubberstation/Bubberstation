      the grille and the cable.
  Melbert:
  - qol: Gun Flipping is now done by right clicking the gun when it's in your active
      hand ("use secondary"), meaning you should be less likely to accidentally spin
      your gun instead of ejecting rounds / racking / etc.
  - qol: You can gun flip all guns, instead of just ballistics. This includes stuff
      like wands.
  OrionTheFox:

  SkyratBot:
  - bugfix: exorcised a ghost of the gang gamemode from graffiti
  - rscadd: Voltaic Yellow Wine - New "base" drink, found in booze-o-mat. No special
      effects besides acting as a weak ethereal food. Not very potent in terms of
      alcohol.
  - rscadd: Telepole - New mixed drink themed after thunderstorms, gives the same
      shock-resist grey bull does. Made from 1 part Voltaic Wine, 1 Part Sake, and
      2 parts Dark & Stormy.  Moderately potent.
  - rscadd: Pod Tesla - New mixed drink, themed after the old removed tesla engine
      (the singulo gets a cocktail, it should too!) Grants a brave - bull phobia resist,
      and a stronger grey bull shock resist allowing you to (temporarily) resist tesla
      arcs from reactive armor and the SM's tesla coils. Gives a pleasant thought
      to whoever drank it, because this thing is a pain to make. Made from 5 parts
      admiralty, 5 parts telepole, and 3 parts brave bull. Highly potent.
  - qol: Unsure if this counts as QOL or balance, but the fact sol dry is in 3 different
      cocktails but the bartender has to buy 30u cans of it made me feel it deserved
      being added to the soda dispenser.
  - image: 'Added graphics for the above drinks, shown below, from left to right:
      Pod tesla, Voltaic Yellow wine, Telepole, Voltaic Wine (bottle)
