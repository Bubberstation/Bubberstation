      even fall at all!). This has been corrected to allow you to punt them down to

      yet.
  - bugfix: (unrevealed) revenants can now move up and down more freely, without having
      to be standing on or below open space. This also applies to other living mobs
      with generic incorporeal movement (not to be confused with the nightmare or
      wizard's jaunt) as long as they can fly or there's no gravity.
