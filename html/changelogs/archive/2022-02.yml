      a roundstart heretic item. Research is handled through their antag info UI.
      Rune drawing is done by using a writing tool with Mansus Grasp active in your
      offhand. The actual Codex is an unlockable ritual item now. expansion: The Living
      Heart is no longer a roundstart heretic item - their actual heart now becomes
      their Living Heart, and it makes a sound when triggered. Losing your heart (being
      disemboweled) will require you to do a ritual to regain it. expansion: The Hereic
      Antag UI has been overhauled, and now hosts much of their mechanics as well
      as providing some helpful tips for newer players. expansion: Most heretic spells
      now require a focus to cast. All heretics can make a basic focus necklace, and

      focus sprite!) expansion: Heretics now passively gain +1 influence every 20
      minutes. expansion: Heretic sacrificing  has been reworked. You can now sacrifice
      people who are in soft crit or weaker. Sacrificing someone heals them, cuffs
      them, and teleports them to the SHADOW REALM, where they must dodge a barrage
      of hands to survive. Survive long enough and you return without memory - die,
      and your body will be thrown back. expansion: Heretics now have a few new rituals,
      including the Ritual of Knowledge, a randomly generated ritual that awards knowledge
      points. expansion: Heretic ascension now has a few requirements - you must complete
      your objectives assigned to you prior to learning the final ritual, and all
      the final rituals have been changed a bit! qol: Using the Heretic''s Mansus
      Grasp on surfaces (EX: Rust Grasp) now works on right-click, instead of combat
