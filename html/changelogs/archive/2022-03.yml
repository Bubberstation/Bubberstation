  - rscadd: On DeltaStation, Nanotrasen realized that the "Pumping Room" they elaborately
      crafted for Atmospherics wasn't actually the part of that division that actually
      moves gas to the rest of the station. They once again elaborately crafted a
      new room (called the "Mixing Room") and shifted everything around. It probably
      doesn't matter to YOU, though.

      will actually breathe the air inside the tube and will respond to the gas accordingly
      (they''ll suffer from breath loss if not in proper atmosphere inside the tube)

      allowing the patient to sleep'
