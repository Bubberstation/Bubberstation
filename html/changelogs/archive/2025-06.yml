  TealSeer:
  - server: increment DB schema version to 5.32
  - server: changed column name in manifest table from character to character_name because the former is a reserved word
  - bugfix: changed round start manifest DB queries from dozens of individual inserts to one mass insert
  - bugfix: hopefully fixed some lag on round start
