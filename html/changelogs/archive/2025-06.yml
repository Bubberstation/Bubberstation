  00-Steven:

      it, again.
  - bugfix: Certain items, like canvases or syringe guns, are no longer weirdly offset
      when placed on tables.
  - bugfix: Placing items on racks, closets, crates, hoops, beds, conveyor belts,
      and pin the tail corgi posters is animated again, instead of instantly teleporting
      followed by the pickup animation.
  - bugfix: Placing a canvas on an easels no longer applies a random offset as if
      dropped.
  - bugfix: Tucking in someone else actually animates the bedsheet from you to them,
      instead of from them to them.
  - qol: Placing a canvas on an easel is animated.
  Ezel:
  - bugfix: Catwalk ordnance cycling airlocks properly cycle again.
  Ghommie:
  - refactor: Refactored crafting backend. Report possible pesky bugs.
  - balance: the MEAT backpack (from the MEAT cargo pack) may be a smidge different
      because of code standardization.
  JohnFulpWillard:
  - qol: internal tanks gives a progress bar when you toggle them, allowing you to
      see how much you've consumed so far.
  - refactor: Cyborg's modules now use storage (so opening a bag will close modules
      instead of overlap one over the other).
  - qol: Observers can now see Cyborg's inventories (like they can for humans).
  - bugfix: The title bar is back for non-fullscreen users.
  - qol: The escape menu no longer blurs the game in the background.

      and laptops
  SmArtKar, MrMelbert:
  - rscadd: Some bloodtypes now have unique behavior, such as liquid electricity blood
      glowing in the dark, podpeople "water-blood" not staining items or turfs, and
      oil not transferring viruses.
  - rscadd: Non-blood blood now contains DNA, meaning that, for example, Ethereal
      blood works just fine for making a vaccine in a PANDEMIC machine.
  - rscadd: Cyborgs and bots can now leave bloody (or oily) tracks if their wheels
      get stained.
  - balance: Slimepeople are now capable of bleeding (slime jelly), be careful with
      knives!
  - balance: Oil blood now requires welding fuel to be restored, slime jelly can be
      restored with stable plasma and snail lube with silicon (previously all 3 were
      affected by iron). Saline solution no longer works on non-iron-based blood.
  - bugfix: Mindless monkeys and big manipulators should be able to harvest replica
      pods now.
  - bugfix: Reagents that went inside of a mob no longer lose some of their properties
      when sucked back out.
  - bugfix: Burdened chaplain's blessing now properly plays its SFX and grants a moodlet
      when successful, instead of doing so upon failure.
  - code_imp: Optimized human rendering slightly.
  - refactor: Species reagent interactions now are fully handled by their livers.
  - refactor: Refactored all blood decals and a lot of mob blood handling code, report
      if anything is broken!
  TealSeer:
  - server: increment DB schema version to 5.32
  - server: changed column name in manifest table from character to character_name
      because the former is a reserved word
  - bugfix: changed round start manifest DB queries from dozens of individual inserts
      to one mass insert
  - bugfix: hopefully fixed some lag on round start
  Y0SH1M4S73R:
  - bugfix: Fixes assembly shells not taking power from machines/mechs/borgs instead
      of needing a cell when attached to such things. Did you know this was supposed
      to be a feature, but didn't work for who-knows-how-long?
  - bugfix: If you find a custom shuttle flight control console that was created by
      an admin or loaded as part of the map, you can dismantle it with a screwdriver.
  necromanceranne:
  - balance: Caged mechs cannot accept silicon pilots. AI uploaded pilots, AI control
      beacons, MMIs or positronics. Malfunctioning AIs can still dominate these mechs.
  - code_imp: Allows for a higher degree of granularity for what mechs can and cannot
      accept by including additoinal mecha flags to block beacon type installations,
      pilot uploads and so on.

      that other stations do.

  - rscadd: Added bloodroaches, a rare variant of cockroaches that explode into a
      shower of blood when squashed.
2025-06-06:
  Absolucy:
  - balance: Changeling Void Adaptation no longer fully negates their breathing -
      instead, it removes their NEED to breathe oxygen, but they will still breathe,
      meaning they'll still be affected by gases such as N2O and BZ.
  Bisar:
  - code_imp: A proc has been added to the subsystem for ID access to serve to standardize
      the way information is read and returned from a given ID.
