  GoldenAlpharex:
  - rscadd: A Hemophage's pulsating tumor will now corrupt nearby internal organs,
      hijacking them for its own purposes... Meaning that a Hemophage's organs (outside

  - qol: Corrupted organs now decay 10 times slower when no tumor is present in their
      body, taking around 100 seconds instead of 10 to fully decay. That means you

      not that much.

      granted that it spent at least some time in an alive person's body between the

      behavior to the actual organs, meaning that the species itself doesn't handle
