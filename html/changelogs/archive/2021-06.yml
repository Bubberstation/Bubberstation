2021-06-22:
  ATHATH:
  - bugfix: Stunning a cyborg with a contractor baton now puts your contractor baton
      on cooldown, just like knocking a human down does. Don't worry, you can still
      easily chainstun/baton 'n' bash borgs with contractor batons.
  - soundadd: Attempting to stun a cyborg with a classic baton or a telebaton will
      play a CLONGing noise, produce a special message, and put your baton on cooldown.
      Harmbatonning cyborgs with classic batons and telebatons still works, of course.
  - refactor: The code for classic batons, telebatons, and contractor batons has been
      doc'd slightly better and refactored a bit.
  - bugfix: Some edge cases involving cyborgs who somehow both are clumsy and can
      wield a classic baton have been accounted for. This shouldn't affect normal
      gameplay unless an admin tries some REALLY weird stuff. Like, clumsy contractor
      cyborg level weird.
  SkyratBot:
  - bugfix: Fix some runtimes with quirks and equipping silicons.
  - bugfix: Eggs now give 5u yolk no matter what it is cracked in
  - balance: The traitor's Agent ID card has a new option available during forging
      called Wallet ID Spoofing. Selecting this option will automatically snap the
      Agent ID card to the front of any wallet, allowing the traitor to hide more
      valuable ID cards behind it. This is disabled when the card is unforged.
  - refactor: Refactors dbcore.dm to possibly resolve the crashes that happen on Terry.
  coiax:
  - tweak: You can now open your own mail, even after being mindswapped into a different
      body. Or being podcloned. Or some other horrific body replacement experiment.

      afterwards.

      in the first place.

  OrionTheFox:
  - bugfix: Delta/Meta's windows overlooking the ERT hangar no longer have grilles
      covering all the furniture. Whoops.
  SkyratBot:
  - balance: Agent ID cards can now steal accesses wirelessly from other players by
      right click slapping them with the agent ID card. This operation is completely
      covert, minus the fact you have to hold your ID card in your hand to initiate
      it.
  - balance: Agent ID cards can now steal accesses wirelessly from ID cards in containers
      including bags, wallets, tablets and PDAs without having to open them or remove
      ID cards first by right clicking. You can still open containers to steal accesses
      from exact cards as before.

2021-06-28:
  Arkatos:
  - bugfix: Spider egg clusters now stop processing when they mature to improve performance.
  - refactor: Spider egg clusters were integrated into the mob spawner system. This
      means you will now see grown spider eggs in the ghost spawners interface.
  - admin: Alien-banned players are no longer allowed to spawn from the spider egg
      clusters.
  Bluetshirtguy, RaveRadbury:
  - imageadd: New emojis for OOC chat and Mime PDAs
  SkyratBot:
  - rscadd: Added funtionality so free golems get an alert from policy.json.
  - rscdel: Deleted a line of text for Free golem's flavor text. Since in my opinion
      the spawn-in text, with the addition of the policy.json text was a bit too much.

      accidentally modified (Old: 30 and 30, New: 25 and 21)'

      charge mechanic is now unique to their stomache and can be transferred freely'
  - rscadd: Baseball bats can now be used to break kneecaps with their right click
      attack. This requires the target to be one of either prone, immobilised or buckled
      to something. If you aim for the legs and right click, you'll wind up a swing
      for the kneecaps. Research indicates that this isn't good for the target's legs.
  ninjanomnom & Trina (Sprites):
  - rscadd: Stationary tanks can now be constructed using most materials. Start the
      frame with a stack of plasteel.
  - balance: Stationary tanks are no longer bigger on the inside than the outside.
  - rscadd: Stationary tanks now merge together when adjacent so you can make large
      gas storage structures.

      in particular is now equal to a circular saw in terms of wounding.
  - balance: Scalpels are an eensy bit less effective at wounding enemies wearing
      armor, though they are still very effective at causing bleeding.

      approval
