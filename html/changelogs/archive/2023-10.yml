  Hatterhat:
  - balance: Bullets have had their base type's wound bonus reduced back to 0, down
      from 20, because wounds are actually quite punishing. Funnily enough, most bullets
      already have modified wound bonuses - except c9mm, c10mm, and most incendiaries,
      so this probably doesn't change much.

      to TG balance standards. Knockdown on hit, 60 instead of 110 damage, etc. etc.

      realized it existed.
