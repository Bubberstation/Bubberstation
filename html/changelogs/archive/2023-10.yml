      to select that one type from a radial menu with one option on it.

  - refactor: Adds charges to omens and omen smiting rather than only being permanent
      or one-use. Mirrors now grant seven bad luckers.

      included in the check!)

  - bugfix: Wigs now properly follow your head when you're any non-standard height
  Hatterhat:
  - qol: Examining an ammo box (incl. magazines) now tells you the top loaded round,
      so if you have different ammo types in different magazines, you can at least
      try to figure out which one is which.
  - spellcheck: Ammo boxes (incl. magazines) can now be set to use different phrasing
      for their ammunition (e.g. cartridges, shells, etc. instead of just mixing "rounds"
      and "shells").
  Jacquerel:
  - bugfix: Dying when using (most) shapeshift spells will now kill you rather than
      having you pop out of the corpse of your previous form.
  - bugfix: Damage will now be accurately carried between forms rather than being
      slightly reduced upon each transformation.

      the service techfab and the autolathe.
  GoldenAlpharex:
  - code_imp: Added support to the wet_floor component to make it so the wet overlay
      could not be applied to certain turfs if desired.
  - bugfix: Ice turfs no longer look tiled, and instead look smooth when placed next
      to one-another.
  Melbert:

  Paxilmaniac:
  - code_imp: the deployable component has been tweaked and improved with some new
      options to it
  Profakos:
  - bugfix: Gnomes no longer runtime if they explode while sinking into the ground
  necromanceranne:
  - bugfix: Every person on the station now no longer has the Tranquility Evades the
      Shield Pinky Finger Shovegrab unarmed combat technique, an ancient and forbidden
      strike that allows anyone (literally anyone) to bypass all forms of blocking
      defense by simply not being in combat mode when they shove or grab their target.
      As a direct result, the chakra energy of the Spinward Sector has become severely
      misaligned. Oh well.

  GPeckman:
  - bugfix: Light-Eaten objects can no longer emit light after being turned off and

  jlsnow301:
  - bugfix: Fixed an invisibility exploit on large mobs. Probably better this way
  lizardqueenlexi:
  - refactor: Wraith constructs have been converted to the basic mob framework. NPC
      wraiths are now extra cruel and will attack the lowest-health mob they can see
      at any given time. Make sure this isn't you! Please report any bugs.
  - bugfix: Artificers and juggernauts no longer attack significantly more slowly
      than intended.
  - refactor: Pirate NPCs now use the basic mob framework. They'll be a little smarter
      in combat, and if you're wearing your ID they'll siphon your bank account with
      every melee attack! Beware! Please report any bugs.
  mc-oofert:
  - rscadd: living floor, living flesh, and other stuff for the bioresearch outpost

      together.
