  - refactor: Tremere powers no longer have subtypes for each level.
  - rscadd: Completely redoes how bloodsucker ability descriptions, both the longer
      antag panel and the action button hover over, they will actually tell you actual
      values that the game itself uses for damage, cooldowns, and effect durations
  - balance: Tremere powers can now level up as far as you want.
  - balance: Mesmerize is heavily reworked, now it no longer forces both parties to
      stand still for it to work, but it is obvious to the victim when used, however
      the victim is muted for the duration of the spool up, and will stun and mute
      normally if the do_after completes.

      effectively making it only usable once per person.

  - balance: Thaumaturgy is heavily reworked, it now has a charge system, and while
      the projectile deal less damage, you can shoot a lot more of them, and the projectiles

      overriding eachother
