  - rscadd: "Replaces the roundstart station supermatter with an engine selection beacon. This beacon cannot be moved, and allows you to select the engine to use for the shift. Currently supported engine types are RB-MK2 and The Supermatter Crystal (large/standard)."
  - rscadd: "Nearly every aspect of the RB-MK2 was tweaked in terms of power generation, heat generation, and tritium consumption. It should be somewhat balanced now."
