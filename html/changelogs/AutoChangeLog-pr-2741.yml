  - balance: "Signifigantly changes flechett shotgun rounds. They are a close range ammo with reliable wounding and damage against unarmored with very shitty armor penitration. Damage drops off signifigantly with range."
  - bugfix: "Beehive and Antitide shotgun ammo now properly subtracts damage dropoff instead of adding."
