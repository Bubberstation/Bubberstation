## General Information

Limastation is a medium sized map ported from Talestation in the early days of Bubberstation.

## ARCHIVAL REASON

Unmaintained, and it has not been running on the server's map rotation for multiple months. There's a lot of missing features and overall good mapping sense that makes this station not really popular among the playerbase.
