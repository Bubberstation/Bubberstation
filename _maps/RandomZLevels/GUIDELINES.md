# Away Mission Creation Guidelines
So, you want to make an away mission! They're a lot of fun to play, but they're a challenge to create.
To ensure a consistent standard of quality across away missions, following the guidelines (split into recommended and required)
is beneficial to ensure your PR is merged.

## Recommendations
 * Create a design document
   * This one is good because it lets you make a coherent thought of what you want your away mission to be, and for others to understand its purpose.
 * Don't go alone
   * Away missions are hard work! Making a team of different specializations helps out massively with workload and speed of the project.
 * Communicate with Maintainers
   * During the creation of your away mission, it is highly recommended you communicate with maintainers to ensure major changes do not have to be made when it's finished.

## Design Requirements
 * Minimum average time to complete: 60 minutes
   * Bare minimum, it should take a team of 4-6 60 minutes to complete.
 * Design around 4-6 players
   * The optimal size of a gateway is 4-6, but know that more or less may participate.
 * Not purely PvE
   * Design your gateway with more than just regular simplemobs in mind. Add puzzles, story, PVP, boss fights, etc. to spice up the gameplay instead of a slog of simplemobs.
 * Loot should not be extreme
   * The gateway's loot should mostly be given in the purview of using it in the gateway itself (final boss loot and similar not withstanding).
   * Loot that's unusable outside the gateway is given more leeway.
   * Loot should not be the primary encouragement for someone to go through the gateway.
