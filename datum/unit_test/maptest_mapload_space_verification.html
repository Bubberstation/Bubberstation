Let's just make sure that we have a stop-gap measure in place to catch these if they pop up so we don't put it onto production servers should something errant come up.</p><table class="summary" cellspacing="0"><tr><td colspan="2"><h2>Procs</h2></td></tr><tr><th><a href="datum/unit_test/maptest_mapload_space_verification.html#proc/validate_planetary_map">validate_planetary_map</a></th><td>Verifies that there are ZERO space turfs on a valid planetary station.
