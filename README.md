This is Bubberstation's downstream fork of Skyrat, which is in turn a fork of tgstation.

**Please note that this repository contains sexually explicit content and is not suitable for those under the age of 18.**

Space Station 13 is a paranoia-laden round-based roleplaying game set against the backdrop of a nonsensical, metal death trap masquerading as a space station, with charming spritework designed to represent the sci-fi setting and its dangerous undertones. Have fun, and survive!

## Compilation

Find `BUILD.bat` here in the root folder of tgstation, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile.

**The long way**. Find `bin/build.cmd` in this folder, and double click it to initiate the build. It consists of multiple steps and might take around 1-5 minutes to compile. If it closes, it means it has finished its job. You can then [setup the server](.github/guides/RUNNING_A_SERVER.md) normally by opening `tgstation.dmb` in DreamDaemon.

**Building tgstation in DreamMaker directly is deprecated and might produce errors**, such as `'tgui.bundle.js': cannot find file`.
