/**
 * Turns whoever enters into a mob or random person
 *
 * If mob is chosen, turns the person into a random animal type
 * If appearance is chosen, turns the person into a random human with a random species
 * This changes name, and changes their DNA as well
 * Random species is same as wizard swap event so people don't get killed ex: plasmamen
 * Once the spring is used, it cannot be used by the same mind ever again
 * After usage, teleports the user back to a random safe turf (so mobs are not killed by ice moon atmosphere)
