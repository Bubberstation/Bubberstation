	1.) Thou shalt not attack the unready!<br>
	Those who are not ready for battle should not be wrought low. The evil of this world must lose
	in a fair battle if you are to conquer them completely. Lesser creatures are given the benefit of
	being unready, keep that in mind.
	<br>
	<br>
	2.) Thou shalt not attack the just!<br>
	Those who fight for justice and good must not be harmed. Security is uncorruptable and must
	be respected. Healers are mostly uncorruptable and if you are truly sure Medical has fallen
	to the scourge of evil, use a declaration of evil.
	<br>
	<br>
	3.) Thou shalt not attack the innocent!<br>
	There is no honor on a pre-emptive strike, unless they are truly evil vermin.
	Those who are guilty will either lay a hand on you first, or you may declare their evil. Mindless, lesser
	creatures cannot be considered innocent, nor evil. They are beings of passion and function, and
	may be dispatched as such if their passions misalign with the pursuits of a better world.
	<br>
	<br>
	4.) Thou shalt not use profane magicks!<br>
	You are not a warlock, you are an honorable warrior. There is nothing more corruptive than
	the vile magicks used by witches, warlocks, and necromancers. There are exceptions to this rule.<br>
	You may use holy magic, and, if you recruit one, the mime may use holy mimery. Restoration has also
	been allowed as it is a school focused on the light and mending of this world.
