Specifically generates the tier 1-4 knowledges + start ones for each path as well for the preview (should probably be moved to use the actual list of per-path researches)
Importantly, this adds HKT_NEXT's for the starting knowledges so the heretic's next researches are considered valid</td></tr><tr><th>/proc/<a href="global.html#proc/make_knowledge_id">make_knowledge_id</a></th><td>ID's are not unique, the same knowledge with the same type in the same shop will always have the same ID.</td></tr><tr><th>/proc/<a href="global.html#proc/determine_drafted_knowledge">determine_drafted_knowledge</a></th><td>Each heretic has a few drafted knowledges within their heretic knowledge tree.
This is not during the knowledge tree creation because we want to know what path our heretic picks so we filter out dupe knowledges.
Also generates shop knowledges as their validation is shared.
Modifies shop_list and final_draft that are provided in the arguments.</td></tr></table></main><footer>tgstation.dme <a href="https://github.com/Bubberstation/Bubberstation/tree/6f9534245f6171fa0aa17ea887605397ec3e9719">6f95342</a> (master) â€” <a href="https://github.com/SpaceManiac/SpacemanDMM/blob/master/crates/dmdoc/README.md">dmdoc 1.11.0</a></footer></body></html>
