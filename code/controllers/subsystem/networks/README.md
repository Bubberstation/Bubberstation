# Networks: Subsystems that are conceptually networked IN-GAME
### Specifically, these subsystems are for in-game mechanics that are intended to rely on a digital/radio/physical network, such as telecomms servers or the powernet

The intent of this folder categorization is to be able to quickly reference what are intended to be in-game networks, vs what is logically networked inside the code.

Knowing what is meant to be conceptually working off of an in-game network serves as guidance for adding or modifying features or fixing oversights and/or bugs.

For instance, the radio jammer only affecting headsets and suit sensors could benefit from a shorthand awareness of other systems that are represented as a network, such as research. Using the radio jammer near a server or fabricator could cause it to sever its link to the supply silo or the research web.
This example is presented only as such, and not a recommendation on any new features or balance changes.
