Remember, union dues cost around 70,000 credits a year. A new video game system with the latest hits sounds like fun. Put your money towards that instead of paying dues to the union.
Remember, tickets & food to the Toolbox Tournament aren't cheap. That money in union dues you'd be paying every year could sure go a long way.
Remember, nothing's more enjoyable than a night out watching a thunderdome match with your buddies. All those union dues you pay every year could buy a few rounds.
Nanotrasen's open door policy is designed to help you feel comfortable taking up issues to your assigned head of staff. It's hard for us to maintain this when they're dead.
Have you ever considered that you're simply less valuable? Work longer hours and get promoted for more pay, rather than paying for a union.
The money spent on you could be spent on humans that do their job rather than pick their nose and fuck all shift.
Remember, non-human crew aren't LESS valuable, they just don't work as hard as human workers!
