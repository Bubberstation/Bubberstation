Greyscaled Medals

Highly modular and customizable spriteset.
Just a note - the .jsons will NOT agree with having different amounts of components per icon.
Use the 'blank' icon to keep the medals all sorted in their correct file,
even if they have different numbers of components.

Potential future ideas:
- Tie to job hours
- Unlock in Loadout when a requirement is met (i.e. job hours, as above)
- Department medals (adding to TG's existing medal lockboxes)
