Comprehensive list of stuff that needs to be done in future PRs:

- Set up parameters for frills, fluff, xeno dorsals, musroom caps, and wings.
- Implement proper sprite offset handling, as it currently assumes the human should be always placed in the middle.
- Remove all part toggles aside from the mismatched parts one.
- Set up some dummy sprites and parameters for tesh and vox.
