Or something, I dunno, all I know is that I prototyped it on SR with synths, then did a shitton of heavy lifting on my own fork before I ended up porting it back here, and it let me use mutant parts with very, very little effort on my fork, so.

From Artea with love, or something.

Also with slight frankensteining of existing code cause I **really** don't feel like refactoring everything to do with mutant parts a second time.
