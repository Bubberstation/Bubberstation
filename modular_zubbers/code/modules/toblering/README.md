## Toblerone Walls
AKA what the wallening honestly should've been. In my opinion:tm:.

Thank you to (especially) horizon, pariah, and daedalus for doing a lot of the heavy lifting for the implementations over the years.
Crumpaloo for getting the initial spritework done on the walls and especially the wallmounts for Artea.
Rimi (me) for modifying the code to work with tgwalls modularly, as adding lowwalls and wall reinforcement would be a complete nightmare. Also some sprite changes to ensure bubber doesn't start inhering Artea's art style.
