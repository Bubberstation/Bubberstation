// Curse of Madness. Gave everyone a lobotomy tier trauma that could basically fuck over your round for no reason.

// Staff of Change: It's all fun and games until someone is transformed into something butcherable and someone "accidentally" butchers someone.
// Very easy way to get round removed, and a very easy way to grief the crew as you are now a funny xenomorph that can lay eggs.

// Blood in a Bottle: Spawns a Slaughter Demon. Players consumed are effectively round removed until the slaughter demon dies.
// 99% of slaughter demons just target medbay and it's not really fun for anyone except the slaughter demon (and ghost chat).
