# Storyteller event overrides/defines

## Existing events
All tg/skyrat event categorizations and adjustments are to be done in the correct track folder, in a .dm file whose name specifies it is an override.

(An exception applies to antag rolls, which are handled independently from any tg or skyrat code)

Some events might have multiple severities, these are to be put in the "multitrack" folder (If you don't see one that means there are no such events *yet*. Feel free to add it!)

## New events
So you have decided to create a new event. Depending on how much code you might need to write, you either create a single dm file in the relevant folder, or create a subfolder if you need more code!
