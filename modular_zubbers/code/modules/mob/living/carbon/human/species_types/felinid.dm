		They are susceptible to laser pointers and hairballs. \

		"Felinids are generally fairly aloof and cat-like in their behavior, and often sleep for long hours with little productivity. \
		They tend to seek short-term thrills in the times that they are awake, and are generally looked down upon by their human counterparts. \
		Despite how it may seem, many felinids are perfectly capable of higher thought and are able to integrate into human communities with little issue as a result of \
		their shared cultural background and pet-like demeanor, but for one obstacle-- Green Tuesday, 2203.",
		"It all started when Felinids were first created on Luna, the Terran moon. \
		Produced as a personal project of the CEO of Interdyne Pharmaceutics at the time, humanity generally (and rightfully) found their existence abhorrent. \
		Despite this, they would go on to live relatively normal lives on Luna's colonies, often studying Asian languages as they were the most commonly spoken. \
		This changed in 2203 when a set of Nanotrasen cloning machines were disrupted (knowingly or not) by the waste produced by a nearby Interdyne facility. \
		The early prototype cloners were damaged by the introduction of toxic sludge to their interiors, and would produce faulty products en masse-- \
		namely, the Felinids, at varying levels of intelligence.",
		"The local Martian government ordered Interdyne to produce industrial quantities of nerve agent in order to cull the population of cloned Felinids emerging \
		from the vats, that would ultimately produce the stigma that would cause cloning to be heavily restricted in the Galactic Federation. Several high-profile \
		corporate officials would be tried for crimes against Felinidity at the Hague as a result of what would come to be known as \"Green Tuesday\" and would directly \
		result in the severe delay of formalized talks with the galactic community until 2209. Many of those tried after this incident would go on to be charged with eternal servitude as first-gen cyborgs. For many, it is a black stain on the history of Humanity.",
		"Despite their place in the universe, Felinids have found surprising acceptance among Tajaran communities, who find common cause with the outcast subhumans, or generally \
		find them less insufferable. Many felinids go on to receive genetic modification to more closely resemble Tajarans due to a sense of failing to belong with humans, or \
		move to Felinid enclaves in Terran space where they can be alone and in good company. These enclaves are generally fairly isolationist, and have formed a Creole called \
		\"Nekomimetic\" in order to communicate amongst themselves. Notable Felinid cells have begun to spring up in the past century as a result of severe isolation and \ oppression, generally targetting public infrastructure and cat caf√©s, which are considered cultural appropriation by radical groups. \
		Despite many efforts over the years, including reparations, it is unlikely that the rift between Felinids and humanity can ever be truly mended.",
