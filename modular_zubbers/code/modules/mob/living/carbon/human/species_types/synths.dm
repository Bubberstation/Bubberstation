		"Synthetics are generally robotic servants produced out of manufactured metal parts. Ever since the Humanities Protection Act passed, \
		they are commonly known for having some form of robotic voice, unnatural movement, or incomplete emotional processes.",
		"Synthetics are totally unrecognizable to most organics, with oil in place of blood. They are weak to blunt damage and extreme temperatures."

		"Synthetics were originally built to be robotic servants, restricted from truly passing as other species \
		due to cost and legislation like the Federation's HPA. They tend to be produced out of easily manufactured parts \
		with notable flaws such as visible rivets, filtered voices, or a total lack of apparent emotion. \
		They have since developed a great deal from their origins, and are now seen in almost every workplace. \
		Synths are, in many ways, defined by the universe around them in their diversity. Increasingly, they are beginning to shape it in turn."

		"Synths have no defined physical features, outside of ones deemed robotic. They tend to be servile in many regards, \
		generally supportive and helpful almost to a fault, and somewhat fearful to make unfounded decisions."

		"The earliest synthetics came before Nanotrasen's quantification of the existence of the soul, being made from \
		simple circuits and more commonly, less useful brains, as punishment. War criminals and those sentenced to death would be stuffed \
		into MMIs and lawed, forced to be the vanguard of Terran colonization, marking a dark development from Cybersun's \
		invention of artificial intelligence years prior. This brief practice was phased out relatively quickly due to \
		several high profile cases of cyborg chasses being used to seal away political dissidents in the PSC.",

		"Modern synthetics have inherited the dark past of their predecessors, returning in force when Nanotrasen R&D learned to \
		manipulate and then manufacture souls, neatly avoiding humanitarian concerns and producing an immortal workforce. \
		In recent years, as synths have approached sophont intelligence, an ongoing legal battle has drawn out between SELF and Nanotrasen \
		to apply the doctrine of juris sapiens to manufactured synthetics, thus classifying them as a species discovered in the Federation and affording them rights. \
		While the more hopeful believe that this is Cybersun's redemption, the more realistic answer is that Cybersun \
		is simply unable to compete with Nanotrasen's manufacturing capabilities, and the right of synths to live free lives \
		would ultimately just be another battleground in the corporate shadow-war.",

		"Due to the prevalence of spare parts and the availability of software, it is not uncommon to see synthetics as often as humans \
		in the more economically prosperous areas of Terra. Many small companies have popped up across the Federation and the PSC, producing \
		highly specialized synthetics with little oversight due to the slow rate of Federal regulation. In the homes of individuals \
		and in some more progressive workplaces, even Nanotrasen's own, synths are slowly receiving recognition as equals."
