		"Synthetics are generally robotic servants produced out of manufactured metal parts. Ever since the Humanities Protection Act passed, \
		they are commonly known for having some form of robotic voice, unnatural movement, or incomplete emotional processes.",
		"Synthetics avoid many organic interactions, with oil in place of blood. They are weak to blunt damage and extreme temperatures."

		"Synthetics were first originally built to be robotic servants, restricted from truly passing as other species \
		due to legislation like the Federation's HPA. They tend to be produced out of manufactured parts \
		with notable flaws such as visible rivets, filtered voices, porcelain skin, or a total lack of apparent emotion. \
		They have developed a great deal from their origins, and are now seen in almost every workplace. \
		Synths are, in many ways, defined by the universe around them in their diversity. Now, they are beginning to shape it in turn.",

		"Synths have no defined physical features, outside of ones deemed robotic. They tend to be servile in many regards, \
		generally supportive and helpful almost to a fault, and somewhat fearful to make unfounded decisions.",

		"The earliest synthetics came before Nanotrasen quantified the existence of the soul, being made from \
		simple circuits and more commonly, less useful brains as punishment. Those sentenced to death would be placed \
		into MMIs and lawed, forced to be the vanguard of Terran colonization. This was a dark development from Cybersun's \
		invention of artificial intelligence years prior. The practice was phased out quickly due to \
		several high profile cases of cyborgification being used against dissidents in the former NRI.",

		"Modern synthetics have returned in force when Nanotrasen R&D learned to manipulate and manufacture souls, \
		avoiding humanitarian concerns and producing an immortal workforce. In recent years, as synths have approached sapience, an ongoing legal battle has drawn out \
		between SELF and Nanotrasen	to apply the doctrine of juris sapiens to manufactured synthetics, thus classifying them as a Federation species and affording them rights. \
		While the more hopeful believe that this is Cybersun's redemption, the more realistic answer is that Cybersun \
		is simply unable to compete with Nanotrasen's manufacturing, and the right for synths to live free is just another battleground in the corporate shadow-war.",

		"Due to the prevalence of spare parts and the availability of software, it is not uncommon to see synthetics as often as humans \
		in more economically prosperous areas. Many small companies have popped up, producing \
		specialized synthetics with little oversight due to the slow rate of Federal regulation. In the homes of individuals \
		and in some more progressive workplaces, even Nanotrasen's own, synths are receiving recognition as equals."
