		Around the 2080s TerraGov encountered the Alliance, the predecessors to GalFed, and engaged in a long-standing rivalry with them until 2140.\
		During this period, Sol found itself in 9 wars with the Alliance, winning 5 and losing 4. The last of these wars were a crushing defeat, \
		and left TerraGov under the influence of the Alliance.",
