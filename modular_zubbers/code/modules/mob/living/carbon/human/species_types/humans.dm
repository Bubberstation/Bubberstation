		"It is rare to find a sun that has not shone on the face of Humanity. Humans are often drawn up against other species for comparison, and for very good reason. \
		Human culture initially seems oxymoronic-- highlighting the individual in service of collective gain, which has led them to every known corner of the universe. \
		It is exactly this apparent paradox that has led humans to make their mark on the stars. No two humans are the same, evading simple definition. \
		Humans are known for having an impressive way of defying their environment and upbringing.",

		"Humans are a social, complicated species that have spread across the galaxy in a blisteringly short timespan, owing to their exploratory nature. \
		Humans originate from Terra within the Sol star system, largely hailing from the United Terran Systems or Pan-Slavic Commonwealth. \
		In the modern day, humans take a prominent role in galactic politics. The capitalist doctrine of Humanity has bled into every major nation, \
		with the Federation effectively becoming a corporatocracy. Megacorporations heavily influence both domestic and foreign affairs.",

		"The Galactic Federation has its beginnings in the Osaka Accords of 2209, treaties of commerce and border control \
		between the United Terran Systems and neighboring Tajaran and Vulpkanin empires. Further treaties would be signed that would deepen \
		the relationship and trade between the Terran Systems and their neighbors, but the geriatric apparatus of the former United Nations and \
		the rate of communications and space travel at the time would make developments extremely slow, and small incidents more impactful on relations. \
		After many years of looking inward, as a result of the Coalition War and border conflicts with the PSC, \
		in 2462 the United Terran Systems would ratify the Heartworlds Treaty, forming the Galactic Federation as we know it today, \
		and paving the way for a modern, Federal army that could better stand up to outside incursion.",

		"The Pan-Slavic Commonwealth traces its roots to the earliest days of space pioneering, when the United Nations still existed as a political identity. \
		During initial colonization efforts, many nations felt excluded by the space programs dominated by larger, often Western and Asian nations. \
		There is little information on how exactly the Commonwealth came to be, though it was preceded by the smaller Third Soviet Union, which would later become \
		The NRI, or Novaya Russiya Imperiya, through a bloody revolution, and finally, the Pan-Slavic Commonwealth, which continues to stand as a legacy \
		of inequality during Earth's early colonization efforts and its alliance is still a cause for concern to the Federation at large. The standard of living \
		in the Pan-Slavic Commonwealth's border regions is particularly poor, making piracy common in states bordering the PSC, even by the Colonial Police.",
