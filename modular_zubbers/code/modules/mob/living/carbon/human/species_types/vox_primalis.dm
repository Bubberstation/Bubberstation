	return list("The Vox seem to be nomadic, bio-engineered alien creatures that operate in and around human space at the behest of crazed and dreaming gods. \
		In reality, we know them to be originally designed by the Vox Auralis, a wholly-reclusive variety of powerful psychics, and present a cold shoulder to all other known cultures, and generally their only visible role on the galactic stage is to act as auxiliary workforce of which they are functionally suited for. \
		The massive moon-sized arkships that serve as their homes travel meandering and convoluted migratory trails through the Milky Way, and the appearance of their looted and repurposed ships is almost always a cause for alarm.",)
