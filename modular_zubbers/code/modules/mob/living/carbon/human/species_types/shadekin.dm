		"It is unclear when exactly Shadekin first spawned, though it is assumedly a relatively recent development. \
		They formed in dark and abandoned places where they are not witnessed-- observation would dispel their creation. \
		When the process completed, the Shadekin collected its ability to move its limbs and communicate from surrounding minds \
		and finally, it formed its first thought, the realization that it is alive.",

		"Shadekin are pitch darkness given form. Light seems to pass through their bodies, which tires them. They do not cast shadows. \
		Shadekin elude definition in terms of size and appearance, as no two Shadekin are the same-- they tend to take features from the species around them \
		that would otherwise not be seen as theirs. For example, Shadekin spawned in Tizira tend to have horns or frill-like ears. \
		An average Shadekin would be slightly shorter than a human, with a similar lifespan. Shadekin that do not use other species' naming conventions will \
		tend to name themselves after their place in the community, like a job or societal function.",

		"Shadekin are capable of reproducing sexually, though their minds need diverse surroundings to properly develop, making them fairly self-guided. \
		Despite this, Shadekin easily find a space of their own, and become staples of their communities. They are more expressive than other species to compensate for a lack of psionic connection. \
		Their language, Marish, is purely empathic and cannot be spoken by psychopaths. Their eye color is an important part of their biology, as it indicates temperament.",

		"A shadekin is never truly alone, however, as Shadekin have formed in number on the treacherous moon Neoma, due to its darkness and isolation. \
		While there is no central Shadekin government, this is the closest thing Shadekin have to a homeworld, devoid of light due to its orbit around Lusine, an extremely hot world that keeps Neoma's surface approaching habitable. \
		It has become a notable tourist attraction in the few habitable areas. Neoma serves an important function of containing the collective knowledge of Shadekin society and its covens.",

		"Covens are groups of Shadekin formed to maintain themselves and records of their existence, as well as guide new Shadekin as they develop. \
		They are rarely associated with ideology alone, rather concepts and what they imply, and within a coven exist Coteries, interest groups within a coven, tailored to a specific aspect. \
		In this regard, covens are societies in and of themselves, organized in a somewhat tribal manner. Covens do not solely exist on Neoma, they are spread throughout the universe, \
		but most covens at least have archives on the moon, called \"Mindtrusts\".",
