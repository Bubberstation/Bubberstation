		"Snailpeople are viscous, slimy beings with a shell on their back. They have no bones, and have two hearts, making their organs remarkably resilient, \
		and they can tolerate eating almost anything short of dairy and sugar. Unfortunately, these impressive evolutionary advantages are offset by the fact that you are a snail."

		"Snailpeople are a species of snail that has evolved from the Common Mollusk, \
		defying expectations after its introduction to the planet Elizabeth II in the Australicus sector. \
		Galactic observers believed that the sentient species that came about mostly by accident during \
		the terraforming process would surely die out due to their slow speed.",

		"They were wrong. Snailpeople just have way too many children, and they taste horrible to predators. \
		Almost 100 years later, they have formed something resembling a functioning civilization. Snailpeople are relatively new to the universe, \
		being forcibly uplifted mostly out of a sense of \"We can't just leave them like this.\" \
		They have tightly packed residential cities, complete with functioning sewer systems, \
		and more, all as a result of generous research investments on the first unique species to be accidentally created by Humanity.",

		"Despite this, the evolutionary failures of Snailpeople mean that their causes of death are usually mundane and deeply saddening. \
		Statistically, the most common cause of death for Snailpeople is a lack of food, or water, due to their pitifully low mobility. \
		They can also die due to prolonged exposure to sea air, making them less common in oceanic planets. This means that when leaving Elizabeth II, \
		they naturally trend towards dangerous environs in order to find work, which also increases their already high mortality rate. \
		They are extremely effective janitors and have an impressive eye for messes and beauty. Socially, their habits resemble humanity's in many ways, \
		though they never developed monogamy. Due to their prolific mating, Snailperson researchers have directly cured most STDs in the known universe.",
