The one a supermatter chamber normally has is fine.</li> <li>Fill up an RB-MK2 rod with 60 moles of tritium and 10 moles of nitrogen. Filling it up more than 70 moles may be dangerous.</li> <li>Place an RB-MK2 rod in each of the RB-MK2 housing units.</li> <li>Ensure the RB-MK2 reactor is connected to the power grid.</li> <li>Wrench down the RB-MK2 rod to activate.</li> <li>Enjoy your passive power generation.</li> </ol> <h2>The Basics of the RB-MK2 reactor</h2> <p>The RB-MK2 powers the station by converting stored Tritium gas into power via a bluespace radiation processing system. The conversion rate is based on the internal temperature of the RB-MK2 rod, so higher temperature would consume more tritium and generate more power. This process generates external heat and waste, so a cooling an filtering system should be used in conjunction with the machine. While complex heating management systems are rewarded with more power generation, a standard Supermatter cooling setup will work fine.</p> <h2>Filling the RB-MK2 reactor rod</h2> <p>RB-MK2 reactor rods should be partially filled with a mix of tritium and a moderator gases, such as nitrogen or plasma. The recommended gasses used for a basic setup is 60 moles of tritium and 10 moles of nitrogen. Note that the type of moderator gas used does not have any inherent effect on the RB-MK2 reactor's power generation capability, only the temperature of the gas and the ratio of gas matters. However, consideration should be made in the choice and the amount of gas used as the RB-MK2 rod will be subject to high and low temperatures as well as high and low pressures during processing, which may result in unintentional internal combustion or reactions. The tank itself has an internal pressure limit of ~3000kPa, and an internal temperature limit of ~1,000,000 kelvin before catastrophic failure. While active, processed tritium flows into the buffer chamber, which is then vented out into the external air.</p> <h2>Turning on the RB-MK2 reactor</h2> <p>The reactor is considered active when a specially designed RB-MK2 tritium rod is inserted and wrenched down into the closed position (rod is flush with the machine). At this point, the generator will process the stored gasses and turn them into power, venting processed tritium and non-tritium gases in the surrounding area. The rod itself works much like a standard internals tank, but is specially designed to fit inside the reactor. As mentioned above, it is important that the rod is not subject to overpressure (~3000kPa) or overheating (1,000,000 kelvin) as that may result in catastrophic ruptures of the tank and a subsequent explosion of the reactor. While the rod is in the closed position, it is still affected by external temperatures, however it will effectively be off.</p> <h2>Reactor Safety</h2> <p>Proper radiation equipment should be used at all times when in proximity to the machine, even when around the chamber. Chamber fires are also possible depending on the buffer gas used and environmental conditions of the external air. Internals should be worn at all times in the reactor main chamber as processed tritium gas will leak from the machine.</p> <p>The RB-MK2 has a safety feature where the rods are forcibly pushed into the open position if the internal sensors detect overpressure or overheating in the rod. This sensor system also prevents reinserting a overheated or overpressurized rod in case of engineer negligence. It is not recommended to tamper with or cut the safety wire in the RB-MK2 maintenance panel as this may void your warranty. Note that use of the safety system may result in damage to the RB-MK2 reactor and may also result in unexpected jams.</p> <h2>Reactor Maintenance</h2> <p>A damaged RB-MK2 reactor can be repaired with a welder tool. Please take care when repairing a reactor in the presence of flammable gasses. In the event of an unexpected jam, it is recommended to use a crowbar to unjam the machine. Note that this may cause additional damage to the machine itself, and may not work entirely if the machine is too damaged.</p> <h2>Reactor Upgrading</h2> <p>Like most machines, the RB-MK2 reactor can be upgraded with stock parts. Upgrading the capacitors increases the power efficiency as well as the amount of tritium consumed per cycle. Upgrading the matter bins increases the gas buffer space of the waste vents. Upgrading the servos increases the strength of the vents, allowing it to vent out in higher pressure areas. The last two options are only useful if you wish to do a unique setup with the reactor's air buffer.</p> <h2>Reactor Wires</h2> <p>The reactor has a series of wires and controls that can be pulsed or cut to change the behaviour of the reactor. There are 8 total wires.</p> <ul> <li>Power Wire: Connects the RB-MK2 reactor to the power grid, if one is present below the machine. High voltage. Cutting this wire disables sending power to the network, mending enables it.</li> <li>Overclock Wire: Increases the power output of the reactor at the cost of reduced efficiency. For advanced users. Pulsing toggles this on/off, while mending turns it off.</li> <li>Activation Wire: Toggles the open/closed state of the reactor. Useful for remote control.</li> <li>Throw Wire: Forcibly ejects the rod from the machine, preventing external gasses from having any effect on the rod. Useful for emergency shut-off. Pulsing or mending performs this action.</li> <li>Vent Power Wire: Delivers power to the vents. High voltage. It is not recommended to tamper with this wire. Pulsing toggles vents on/off, cutting turns it off, mending turns it on.</li> <li>Vent Direction Wire: Controls the directional flow of the vents. Only works if the vent itself is off. For advanced users. Pulsing toggles vent control to flow in/out of the buffer, mending sets it to flow out.</li> <li>Safety Wire: Controls the safety power off system of the RB-MK2 reactor. Pulsing forces the rod into the open position, cutting disables the safety system all together (NOT RECOMMENDED).</li> <li>Cooling Limit Wire: Controls how much cooling is transferred to the RB-MK2 reactor rod. For advanced users. Pulsing increases the percentage by 10% per pulse, up to 90%. Mending resets to 0%.</li> </ul> <h2>Advanced Reactoring Tips</h2> <ul> <li>A rod in the open position is cooled/heated more effectively than in the closed position.</li> <li>It is recommended to use the cooling limit wire to safely increase the internal temperature of the reactor without needing to increase the external air temperature. Note that the cooling limiter has no effect when the rod is in the open position, so it can safely cool in cases of emergencies.</li> <li>You can close the vents and turn off the machine if the exterior temperature is much hotter than the internal rod temperature. This is much safer and reliable than using the safety throw wire.</li> <li>It is possible to unjam the reactor by pulsing the throw wire repeatedly. Note that this will practice can cause damage to the machine, and will void your warranty.</li> <li>It is possible to reverse the vent flow direction to suck in a set amount of cold buffer gas so that you don't have to use external air to cool the machine, allowing the reactor to safely work in a room-temperature environment.</li> <li>Half of the tritium gas processed in the reactor will be vented out from the machine. It is possible to reuse the gas in atmospheric conditions that prevent breakdown into water vapour.</li> </ul>"}
