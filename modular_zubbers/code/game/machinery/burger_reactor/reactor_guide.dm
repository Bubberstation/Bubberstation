The one a supermatter chamber normally has is acceptable. <b>The cooling system must be active any cycling before proceeding.</b></li><li>Fill up an RB-MK2 rod with 80 moles of tritium and 10 moles of nitrogen. While the rods are stronger than standard gas tanks, overfilling may cause damage to the reactor.</li><li>Place an RB-MK2 rod in each of the RB-MK2 housing units.</li><li>Allow the RB-MK2 rods to cool down to the area's temperature.</li><li>Wrench down the RB-MK2 rod to activate.</li><li>Manage the RB-MK2's internal temperature temperature carefully. More heat equals more power, but <b>too much power might result in the safety system being triggered, and in worst cases, trigger a meltdown!</b></li></ol><h2>The Science of the RB-MK2 reactor</h2><p>The RB-MK2 powers the station by converting stored Tritium gas into power via a bluespace radiation processing system. This process generates external heat and waste, so a cooling an filtering system should be used in conjunction with the machine. The conversion rate of tritium to power is based on the internal temperature of the RB-MK2 rod, so higher temperature would consume more tritium and generate more power.</p><h2>Reactor rods</h2><p>RB-MK2 reactor rods works much like a standard internals tank, but specially designed to fit inside the reactor and handle high internal temperatures and pressures. Reactor rods should be partially filled with a mix of tritium and a moderator gases, such as nitrogen. The recommended gasses used for a basic setup is 80 moles of tritium and 10 moles of nitrogen. Note that the type of moderator gas used does not have any inherent effect on the RB-MK2 reactor's power generation capability, only the temperature of the gas and the ratio of gas matters. However, consideration should be made in the choice and the amount of gas used as the RB-MK2 rod will be subject to high and low temperatures and pressure. The tank itself has an internal pressure limit of ~9000kPa, and an internal temperature limit of ~2070 kelvin.</p><h2>Reactor Personal Protection</h2><p>Proper radiation-resistant and cold/heat resistant equipment should be used at all times when in proximity to the machine, even when around the chamber. Chamber fires are also possible depending on the gas mixture used to cool the reactor. Internals should be worn at all times while in the reactor main chamber, as superheated tritium gas may leak from the machine during processing. Magnetic boots are highly recommended when performing work in an active chamber, as you may be exposed to high and low pressures. </p><h2>Reactor Safety</h2><p>The RB-MK2 has a safety feature where the rods are forcibly pushed into the open position if the internal sensors detect unfavourable settings, such as overpressurization or excessive power generation that may cause stray reactions that cannot be handled by the reactor. It is recommended not to tamper with or cut the safety wire in the RB-MK2 maintenance panel, as this may void your warranty and possibly lead to catastrophic meltdowns. Note that each trigger of the safety system will caused damage to the RB-MK2 reactor housing. Excessive damage to the housing can cause jams.</p><h2>Reactor Jams</h2><p>A reactor is considered jammed when a reactor rod is inside but not fully inside the machine. Jams are considered dangerous as the rod is still active and can not be reliably deactivated or ejected in this state. A standard crowbar is recommended to remove jams, and a welder used to repair any damage to the machine.</p><h2>Activating and deactivating the RB-MK2 reactor</h2><p>The reactor is considered active and closed when the rod is fully inserted and flush with the machine. At this point, the generator will process the stored gasses and convert them into usable electrical power, expelling the gasses into the buffer and then into the surrounding air. The reactor is considered inactive and open when the rod is inserted into the machine with the rod mostly or entirely exposed to the open air. The reactor will not process tritium while in the open position. A wrench can be used to manually activate or deactivate the rod, or the interface can be used.</p><h2>Reactor Cooling</h2>While in the default configuration and inserted into the reactor, RB-MK2 rods are cooled or heated by the surrounding external air, regardless of whether or not tritium processing is occuring. Note that the rod is more efficiently cooled while in the open and inactive position, and is limited in the closed and active position. The closed position cooling rate can be managed by manually tweaking the machine via the interface by changing the cooling limiter setting, or completely by closing the vents. Note that closing the vents should only be done in emergencies when the machine is not active and processing and the external air is dangerous to the reactor.</p><h2>Reactor Byproducts</h2>The reactor is known to produce an unknown gas compound that is directly formed in the reactor rod itself at high power generation. Exposure to the gas is not recommended, and any rods containing the gas should be immediately disposed of once it is void of tritium. You should not inhale the gas under any circumstances, regardless of how funny it makes you feel.</p><h2>Reactor Upgrading</h2><p>Like most machines, the RB-MK2 reactor can be upgraded with stock parts. Upgrading the capacitors increases the power efficiency as well as the amount of tritium consumed per cycle. Upgrading the matter bins decreases stray reactivity, thus increasing the amount of power allowed to be processed. Upgrading the servos increases the strength of the vents, allowing it to vent out in higher pressure areas. <b>Note that upgrading the RBMK2 reactor WILL require the user to employ advanced cooling techniques as the amount of heat generated increases with each stage of upgrade.</b></p><h2>Reactor Criticality Events</h2><p>Criticality events, also known as meltdowns, are known to occur in improperly managed reactors. A reactor is considered critical when the amount of power generated overpowers the latches in the reactor, causing the rods themselves to bounce erratically and lead to uncontrolled tritium bluespace reactions. In the event of a meltdown, do the following:</p><ol><li>Do not panic. Warn your fellow engineers of the problem.</li><li>DO NOT ATTEMPT TO DISABLE ANY RODS THAT ARE LEAPING, AS THIS WILL LEAD TO JAMS AND MAY ACCELERATE THE MELTDOWN PROCESS</li><li>Activate any external emergency cooling procedures.</li><li>Acquire the proper protective equipment to enter the chamber safely.</li><li>Disable all RB-MK2 reactor rods that are not leaping erratically.</li><li>Wait for the remaining rods to cease leaping, and disable them.</li><li>In case the integrity or criticality reaching dangerous levels (above 80%), flee the area.</li></ol><h2>Reactor Wires</h2><p>The reactor has a series of wires and controls that can be pulsed or cut to change the behaviour of the reactor. There are 9 total wires. It is not recommended to tamper with these wires unless you know what you're doing.</p><ul><li>Power Wire: Connects the RB-MK2 reactor to the power grid, if one is present below the machine. High voltage. Cutting this wire disables sending power to the network, mending enables it.</li><li>Overclock Wire: Increases the power output of the reactor at the cost of reduced efficiency. For advanced users. Pulsing toggles this on/off, while mending turns it off.</li><li>Activation Wire: Toggles the open/closed state of the reactor. Useful for remote control.</li><li>Throw Wire: Forcibly ejects the rod from the machine, preventing external gasses from having any effect on the rod. Useful for emergency shut-off. Pulsing or mending performs this action.</li><li>Vent Power Wire: Delivers power to the vents. High voltage. It is not recommended to tamper with this wire. Pulsing toggles vents on/off, cutting turns it off, mending turns it on.</li><li>Vent Direction Wire: Controls the directional flow of the vents. Only works if the vent itself is off. For advanced users. Pulsing toggles vent control to flow in/out of the buffer, mending sets it to flow out.</li><li>Safety Wire: Controls the safety power off system of the RB-MK2 reactor. Pulsing forces the rod into the open position, cutting disables the safety system all together (NOT RECOMMENDED).</li><li>Cooling Limit Wire: Controls how much cooling is transferred to the RB-MK2 reactor rod. For advanced users. Pulsing increases the percentage by 10% per pulse, up to 90%. Mending resets to 0%.</li><li>Tamper Wire: A dummy wire that when cut or pulsed, permanently indicates on the circuitboard that the reactor was incorrectly tampered with and that the warranty is now void.</li></ul><h2>Advanced Reactor Usage Tips</h2><ul><li>A rod in the open position is cooled/heated more effectively than in the closed position.</li><li>It is recommended to use the cooling limit wire to safely increase the internal temperature of the reactor without needing to increase the external air temperature. Note that the cooling limiter has no effect when the rod is in the open position, so it can safely cool in cases of emergencies.</li><li>You can close the vents and turn off the machine if the exterior temperature is much hotter than the internal rod temperature. This is much safer and reliable than using the safety throw wire.</li><li>It is possible to unjam the reactor by pulsing the throw wire repeatedly. Note that this will practice can cause damage to the machine, and will void your warranty.</li><li>It is possible to reverse the vent flow direction to suck in a set amount of cold buffer gas so that you don't have to use external air to cool the machine, allowing the reactor to safely work in a room-temperature environment.</li><li>Half of the tritium gas processed in the reactor will be vented out from the machine. It is possible to reuse the gas in atmospheric conditions that prevent breakdown into water vapour.</li></ul>"}

	default_raw_text = {"I can't be bothered to read that guide on the RB-MK2 reactor, and I can't imagine other people want to either. Through experimentation, I found that setting the Emergency Cooling Loop Input to 200K is enough for decent power generation without the need for the powered cooling units and without shit going wrong, assuming the system isn't flooded with too much gas (one canister should be enough). Also don't be weird and replace all the pipes and stuff; the layout is fine. Just keep the Cooling Restrictor valve in the open position."}
