	went back to the bulky design, overclocked it, and made it functional, turning it into what is essentially a literal man portable particle accelerator. \
	The design results in a massive hard to control blast of kinetic energy, with the power to punch right through creatures and cause massive damage. The \
	only problem with the design is that it is so bulky you need to carry it with two hands, and the technology has been outfitted with a special firing pin \
	that denies use near or on the station, due to its destructive nature."
