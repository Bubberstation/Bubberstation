# BUBBERSTATION MODULAR HYDROPONICS

## What to put here
Any completely new seeds, produce, sprites, and mechanics.
Do not put any actual craftable foods here, instead either create or use, (if already created) the relevant modular folder.


Overrides of mechanics on parent repos (TG, Skyrat) should still be done in the code folder.
