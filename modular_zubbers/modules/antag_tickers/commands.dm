	Antag tickets are a way to balance playtime between being an antagonist and being a non-antagonist. \
	Having more antag tickets makes you more likely to be chosen as an antagonist, while having less makes you less likely to be chosen as one. \
	Antag tickets are gained when you're playing as a crew role while not being an antagonist, while antag tickets are spent when you're playing as an antagonist. \
	Note that as an antagonist, you do not lose antag tickets when you're handcuffed, restrained, dead, crit, incapacitated, or in prison."
