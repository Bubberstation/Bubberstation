	desc = "Originally created on earth in 2006, Interslavic has gone through many reforms during the years, especially after the slavic exodus from Earth and Sol. In the times of the NRI, it has also had components from non-slavic species that exist in the NRI adopted into the language, though the main components derive from Russian, Serbian, and Belarussian."
