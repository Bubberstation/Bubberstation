# About this module

This module stores the main parts of the updated teshari -namely, overwriting the original teshari.
Teshari --> Raptor
Related to this is exactly how the rework was done. In order to avoid possible conflicts, the new teshari inherit the code of the old ones. (It's also related to the fact that it's a bit hard to do everything alone).
The race of the previous teshari was renamed Raptor, similar to Antropomorph, and has no special features.

The new teshari, on the other hand, replace the old ones, and are called like them, with a number of distinctive features, including significant physical limitations. For details, see the module content.

MOD suits sprites, HUSK icon and all code by me(Discord Fenysha).
Action buttons by Smol42.
