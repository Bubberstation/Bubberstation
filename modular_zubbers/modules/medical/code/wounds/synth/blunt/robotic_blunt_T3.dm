	treat_text = "Reforming of superstructure via either RCD or manual molding, followed by typical treatment of loosened internals. \
				To manually mold, the limb must be aggressively grabbed and welded held to it to make it malleable (though attacking it til thermal overload may be adequate) \
				followed by firmly grasping and molding the limb with heat-resistant gloves. \
				Surgical intervention is also effective."
