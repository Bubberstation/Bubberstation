## About Output Names

So yeah, these icons have a particular set of output names.
This was done to preserve that's left of my already pretty fucked sanity.

- "stripe" should be used for neighbor stripes.
- "wall" for the walls themselves.
- "shine" for *any* shine. Stripe/wall/whatever, it's all the same name.

## Credit

Thank you to crumpaloo for getting the initial spritework done on these walls for Artea.
Rimi (me) has then modified them so bubber doesn't accidentally start to take on artea's overall artstyle, as retroactively making them similar would be a monumental undertaking, and likely undesired.
