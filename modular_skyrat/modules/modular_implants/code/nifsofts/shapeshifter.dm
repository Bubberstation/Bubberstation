This allows the nanites to reach under the skin and even into the very bone structure of the host; including incorporation of mimetic materials and femto-level manipulation devices all for the purpose of allowing the user to, essentially, shapeshift on a low level. However, despite the incredible complexity behind these processes, there are still limits on the range of 'forms' a user can take. Mass can neither be created nor destroyed, after all, and you can only distribute and rearrange it in so many ways across a functioning humanoid body; meaning, the user cannot adopt forms too far out of their 'true' one."
