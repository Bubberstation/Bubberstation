## About
This automapper is designed to make mapping far easier for modular maps, it should mean less manual map resets(ideally, never).
It supports two types of automapping, simple area automapper and template automapper.

## Simple Area Automapper
What this will do is check an area for a suitable single tile to spawn an object in. It uses "intelligent" heatmapping to choose a suitable place.
It uses an algorithm to decide where to place a singular item, it will avoid blocking hallways or doors.

## Template Automapper
This automapper is designed to load templates over existing maps using a template file and entry in the config toml.
