	name = "Romulus Carbine Conversion Kit"
	desc = "A Romulus-produced conversion kit. This kit includes a lighter frame, and maginally shorter stock and barrel to reduce the overall length and bulk of the Carwo-Cawil rifle. Because of the lighter bolt carrier components, the firearm has a higher cyclic rate, and fires faster. Accepts any standard Sol rifle magazine."
