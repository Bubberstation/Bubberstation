	<br> This meeting, having familiarized itself with all the other possible actions and solutions, came to the conviction that the indenture of fines has casus belli to perform a diplomatic personal meeting.
	<br> The Imperial Regulation has to be enforced in order to minimise any potential threat for the whole Empire, not excluding allied kingdoms, organisations and other partners, and to strengthen our positions in the ongoing Border War.

	<br> We have done some quick modifications to make it more suitable for military use, and smuggled you some defensive and military-grade medical equipment to balance it out. And some SMGs that were so convenient to \"go out of service and get scrapped". It should do the job for now.
	<br> It is worth mentioning that your fourth marine, the maintenance crew man, went on a vacation. Dude's been pretty nervous as of late so it's only fair to let him get some well deserved rest - he has been maintaining this ship the whole time you've been in cryosleep. This should not affect your performance anyways.
